<h1 align="center">C Language Preprocessor</h1>

<p align="justify"> This is a simple C/C++ preprocessor. The goal is to have good conformance with the C and C++ standards and to handle nonstandard preprocessor extensions in gcc / clang / visual studio preprocessors. Most of the preprocessor testcases in gcc and clang are handled OK by simplecpp.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
To run the preprocessor on your computer you must have:
* for **UNIX** based operating systems: 
    * **gcc** - is a tool from the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/) used to compile and link C programs
* for **Windows** operating system: 
    * **cl** -  is a tool that controls the [Microsoft C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options?view=vs-2019) compiler and linker

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

* **Linux**:
    * start by updating the packages list
        ```bash
            $ sudo apt update
        ```
    * install the build-essential package(a package of new packages including gcc, g++ and make) by typing:
        ```bash
        $ sudo apt install build-essential 
        ```
* **Windows**:
    * all you need to do to install **cl** on your machine is to install the [*Microsoft Visual Studio Comunity Edition*](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
